Conducted a comprehensive machine learning workflow on the Hotel Booking Dataset comprising over 119,000 records and 32 features, aimed at predicting booking cancellations and generating actionable business insights.

✅ Key Tasks Completed:
* Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handled missing values in key columns such as children, country, and agent.
Detected and treated outliers in adr and lead_time using statistical techniques.
Converted data types appropriately, including date parsing and categorical encoding.

* Feature Engineering
Created a new categorical feature lead_time_category to group bookings into Short, Medium, and Large lead times.
Scaled numerical features to enhance model performance.
Calculated a weighted cancellation score based on guests' previous booking and cancellation history.

* Exploratory Analysis & Insights
Analyzed seasonal trends and identified peak booking periods.
Determined countries and market segments with the highest cancellation rates.
Ranked hotels dynamically based on cancellation rates.
Isolated frequent guests and high-risk customers through advanced filtering techniques.

* Visualization & Reporting
Developed dynamic charts to visualize cumulative cancellations and booking behavior.
Utilized SQL-based queries to analyze booking trends by hotel type and country of origin.

* Model Building & Evaluation
Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets.
Built and compared multiple classification models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machines.
Tuned model hyperparameters using Grid Search and validated results using cross-validation.
Evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

This project demonstrated a full-cycle data science approach—from data preprocessing and feature engineering to predictive modeling and business insight generation—enabling data-driven strategies to reduce booking cancellations and optimize hotel operations.
